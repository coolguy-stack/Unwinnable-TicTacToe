# Unwinnable-TicTacToe
An old project of mine where I challenged myself to build a TicTacToe bot that always wins or ends in a draw against any player. I used a bit of recursion and a lot of hard coding to build the bot. Developed an extensive knowledge on recusion, optimization, game theory, graphics and 
bot development. You can play this game on this link: https://coolguy-stack.github.io/Unwinnable-TicTacToe/.
